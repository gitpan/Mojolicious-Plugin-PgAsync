Mojolicious::Plugin::PgAsync is a plugin for Mojolicious apps to work asynchronous with PostgreSQL
using DBD::Pg, include listen feature.

TESTING:
--------

The tests rely on being able to connect to a valid Postgres database. 
The easiest way to ensure this is to set the following environment variables:

	DBI_DSN=dbi:Pg:dbname=<database>
	DBI_USER=<username>
	DBI_PASS=<password>

Default: database - "test", username - "postgres", password - "".
